	<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web,or the Web as it is more commonly referred to, is an interconnected system of public webpages from all across the globe that is accesible through the internet. It is an infomation space where web resources such as photos,videos,and text are connected and linked in a collection of webpages found across the internet. It was originally invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee as a way for scientists to easily share data from thier experiments.</p>
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>The World Wide Web works by interconnecting web pages made up of hypertext links formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that display embedded hyperlinks with Unifrom Resource Locators (URL) that permit the user to navigate through other web resources. Websites are usually made up of multiple web pages that share a common theme and domain name. When a user wants to access a web page or website, the data is feteched by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which sends the data over to the client.</p>
	<h3>The role of web servers</h3>
	<p> A web server is a computer software that used HTTP and other similar protocols to answer client request over the World Wide Web, it's main job is to display server content through storing, processign and delivering web pages to users. Esentially, the role of web servers is to host data, whether it be websites,storage,emails,gaming,etc. </p>
    <h3>What are web browsers?</h3>
    <p>A web browser is an application software for accessing the World Wide Web. Web browers receive request from users to access web pages on websites and retrieve the necessary content from a web server to them display the content for the user to see. Web browsers are often confuseed with search engines,however served different purposes, with a search engine only retrieving infomation to aid the user in finding a web page, while a web browser deliviers web page content to the user. </p>

	<h2>World Wide Web vs the Internet</h2>
	<p>The internet and World Wide Web may often be confused as being interchangable words,however this is not the case. The internet is a a global system of interconnected computer networks madeup of countless wired and wireless devices from all across the world.It is essentially a giant distributation system of data and infomation. On the other hand, the World Wide Web is standardised system for accessing and navigating the internet. It is similar to email in the that is only a part of the internet.</p>

	<h2>What it an Intranet? How does it relate to the Internet?</h2>
	<p>A intranet is a private computer network which may be used by an organisation for ease of communcation, sharing of infomation and overall teamwork. Intranets can either be Local Area Networks (LAN) that cover a limited area, typically using ethernet or WI-FI connection, or simply be a private network with specific security options. Intranets are typically limited to specific employees and workers,aimed at boosting productivity,this is unlike extranets,which are also private networks but require are aimed at approved parties for private reasons. Many modern intranets from large organisations may include specific search engines, user profiles and mobile apps. intranets have very little different from the internet other than being exclusive or private.</p>
