	<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW)</h2>
	<p>The World Wide Web,or the Web as it is more commonly referred to, is an interconnected system of public webpages from all across the globe that is accesible through the internet. It is an infomation space where web resources such as photos,videos,and text are connected and linked in a collection of webpages found across the internet. It was originally invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee as a way for scientists to easily share data from thier experiments.</p>
	<h3>How it works</h3>
	<p>The World Wide Web works by interconnecting web pages made up of hypertext links formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that display embedded hyperlinks with Unifrom Resource Locators (URL) that permit the user to navigate through other web resources. Websites are usually made up of multiple web pages that share a common theme and domain name. When a user wants to access a web page or website, the data is feteched by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which sends the data over to the client.</p>
	<h3>The role of web servers</h3>
	<p> A web server is a computer software that used HTTP and other similar protocols to answer client request over the World Wide Web, it's main job is to display server content through storing, processign and delivering web pages to users. Esentially, the role of web servers is to host data, whether it be websites,storage,emails,gaming,etc. </p>
    <h3>What are web browsers?</h3>
    <p>A web browser is an application software for accessing the World Wide Web. Web browers receive request from users to access web pages on websites and retrieve the necessary content from a web server to them display the content for the user to see. Web browsers are often confuseed with search engines,however served different purposes, with a search engine only retrieving infomation to aid the user in finding a web page, while a web browser deliviers web page content to the user. </p>

	<h2>World Wide Web vs the Internet</h2>
	<p>The internet and World Wide Web may often be confused as being interchangable words,however this is not the case. The internet is a a global system of interconnected computer networks madeup of countless wired and wireless devices from all across the world.It is essentially a giant distributation system of data and infomation. On the other hand, the World Wide Web is standardised system for accessing and navigating the internet. It is similar to email in the that is only a part of the internet.</p>

	<h2>What it an Intranet? How does it relate to the Internet?</h2>
	<p>A intranet is a private computer network which may be used by an organisation as a tool for sharing information, collaboration tools,operational systems,and other computing services,usually with the exclusion of access to outsiders.In its simplest form,an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs) Many modern intranets have search engines user profiles,mobile apps with notifications,and events planning within their infrastructure.Intranets are internal and require their own server to store all of thier internal data,devices are connected to an intranet sever either through wires if in a smaller space or via the internet if from a longer distance.Intranets are typically used by larger corporations,often with their own dedicated personnel whom are wired for the IT and telecommunication skills.Intranets uses much of the same technology as the internet such as being both based on the Internet Protocol Suite.</p>

	<h2>What is an internet protocol?</h2>
	<p>An internet protocol or IP, is a set of rules that responsible is for routing and addressing data traversing the internet so that they may travel across networks and find the correct destination. Data that is travelling across the internet is divided into smaller pieces called packets. IP infomation is attacted to each packet, helping routers send them to the right place. Devices and domains are assigned IP addresses that allow for packets with the correct IP infomation to be directed to these addresses, ensuring that the data arrives where it is needed. Once packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on what transport protocol is used in combination with the IP. Internet protocol has 4 intial layers,the application layer,transport layer,internet layer and network access layer. 
	<h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h3>
	<p>
	Hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP, is a application and request-response protocol which allows users to interact with web resources such as HTML documents by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers.HTTP is used for exchanging data on the Web.HTTP clients generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to communicate with servers.HTTP was originally invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive,text-based web browser.Today,it remains one of the primary means of using the Internet.
	</p>
	<h3>(TCP/IP)</h3>
	<p>
	TCP/IP refers to the entire internet protocol suite, with the name coming from the Transmission Control Protocol or TCP and Internet Protocol or IP layers of the suite. TCP itself refers to the communcation protocol used to connect devices to the internet.TCP provides communcation between application programs such as HTTP or FTP and the Internet Protocol.It is used ontop of IP to ensure the reliable and secure transmission of data packets between server and client. When used in conjuction with HTTP for example,TCP is used to maintain the connection between the user and the target to ensure that the packets are sent over. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In comparison the Internet Protocol or IP is a network layer protocol responsible for routing data packets across interconnected networks.The IP protocol facilitates the internetworking neccesary for the fuctioning of the internet. IP routes network packets from the originating host across network boundaries and if neccessary to a destination host specified by a IP address.  
	</p>
	<h3> File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h3>
	<p>File Transfer Protocol or FTP, is an application and communication protocol used for the trandfer of large files from server to client on a computer network.It is used to transfer files from one host to another and allows different devices to upload and download files from the internet.FTP utilises a devices memory in order to save the files whcih are received from the internet.</p>
